# React + Parcel Starter

A minimal React starter, bundled with Parcel, that I usually use in my React projects. I like to keep my projects as minimal as possible and consisting of just the configurations I need, which is why I created this starter project.

## Configurations

- React (v17) with Reach Router
- Parcel
- SCSS modules
- ESLint
- Prettify

## Project Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:1234
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build
```

You can get started by editing `/src/App.js`.
